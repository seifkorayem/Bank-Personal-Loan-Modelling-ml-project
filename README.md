# Naive Bayes & Random Forest Classification Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline for a **classification problem** using multiple models, with a focus on **Naive Bayes** and **Random Forest** classifiers.  
The goal is to preprocess the data, engineer meaningful features, train different models, and evaluate their performance while checking for overfitting.
